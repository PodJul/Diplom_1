*Hey! Thank you for visit this repository. Let me introduce you [Stellar Burgers app](https://stellarburgers.nomoreparties.site/). You can create and order your own unic burger with cosmic ingredients. And while you're doing this, I will test the code of the app and it will be my diploma project.* 

**Stellar Burgers Unit-tests** - the first part of my diploma. I had test Bun, Burger, Ingredient, IngredientType classes,using mocks, stubs, Parametrized.class and dependency injection.

Code coverage is more than 80 percent. You can check it from jacoco report.
